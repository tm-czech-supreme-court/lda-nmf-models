# lda-nmf-models

Dear visitor,

This is **Topic Modelling of Czech Supreme Court Decisions** repository containing 10 latent Dirichlet allocation models topics and 10 non-negative matrix factorization models topics and their keywords. Topics and keywords are visualized using Python library pyLDAvis in separate .html files. The models were trained for *k= (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100)*, where k is the number of topics.

For proper functioning of the visualizations, it is necessary to download the .html files and open them in the browser.

All the information, data and codes relevant to the models are available as *open source* at: https://github.com/tm-czech-supreme-court/lda-nmf.

This experiment was prepared at Masaryk University as part of the project ”Automatic processing of court decisions: user experiment” number MUNI/A/1454/2019 with the support of the Specific University Research Grant, as provided by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic in the year 2020.
