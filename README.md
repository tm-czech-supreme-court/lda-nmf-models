# lda-nmf-models

Dear visitor,

This is a repository of 10 latent Dirichlet allocation models topics and 10 non-negative matrix factorization models topics and their keywords. Topics and keywords are visualized using Python library pyLDAvis in separate .html files. The models were trained for k= (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100), where k is the number of topics.
The models were trained on the Czech Court Decisions Corpus 1.0 Supreme court decisions available at: https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11372/LRT-3052#

For proper functioning of the visualizations, it is necessary to download the .html files and open them in the browser.

The repository is created for the purpose of JURIX 2020 conference paper submission called "Topic modelling of Czech Supreme court decisions" by Tereza Novotná, Jakub Kól and Jakub Harašta.
